## Important notes:
- The code is formatted with [Google's c++ formating style guide.](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html) Though I could format it for you, I would prefer to have it preformatted. To do that, I recommend using vs code with the C/C++ extension, go to File > Preferences > Settings, search ```C_Cpp.clang_format_fallbackStyle``` and replace ```Visual Studio``` with ```Google```.
